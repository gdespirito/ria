# This is a takeaway project for RIA, for a web dev job application. 

I'm building this in Vue3 using compositon API and Typescript. 
We should create just basic tests and using vitest. 

Teakeaway notes: 

## Test project for a small weather application

**Overview**

For the test project a small web app/mobile app should be created which utilizes a simple JSON rest API.
The test is aimed to last about 1-2 hours and should NOT exceed 2 hours as it is NOT expected that the complete scope will be finished as each developer has his own speed, coding style, approach and background knowledge. So it’s up to the developer to manage his own priorities for this test project.
The app itself can be developed either as a Vue web app, Angular web app, Ionic mobile app, native Android mobile app or native iOS mobile app depending on the developers preference and won’thave any influence on the test.

**Scope**
A small weather application should be created with following basic functionalities:

- Show three tabs with predefined cities (Rio de Janeiro, Beijing and Los Angeles)
- Connect to a backend to get the weather data
- Show for the selected city a forecast for the next hours and the next days should be
presented
- The user should get the ability to refresh the data
- On the next page is a mockup for the small weather application
- Weather icons are available at https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
- Bonus: allow to search for a city
For the backend following JSON rest API will be used:
- The API documentation can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api
- The used access key for the API is 9170e0e85794088df319259526c55afd
- The API key is used for the free subscription plan, so please ensure to use the API functions
which are available for that subscription plan
- Please use the API responsibly and keep in mind that excessive or misuse can lead to
temporary blockages
- If your key gets temporarily blocked, please get in touch with us and you can get another key
- Under the link the usage and samples can be found
- Bonus: use the small city meta data https://www.weatherbit.io/api/meta (the one with
~20,000 cities) for the city search
